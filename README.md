# ðŸŒŒ Deep Sky

**Deep sky** is an interactive web app for exploring high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images.
The images are fetched from the official Hubble website and processed into `.dzi` format for efficient web rendering.

Using **OpenSeadragon**, the app provides smooth zooming, panning, and an immersive viewing experience even with massive images.
Users can place pinpoints to mark interesting regions, with all data stored in a lightweight **SQLite** database.

Explore the universe directly in your browser â€” no downloads needed.
Perfect for scientific research, education, or simply admiring the beauty of galaxies.
